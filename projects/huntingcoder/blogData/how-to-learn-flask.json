    "content": "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. It was created by Armin Ronacher and first released in 2010. Flask is known as a microframework because it provides the core features needed to build web applications without forcing a specific structure or additional tools. It is built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine. Flask is widely used for building web applications, REST APIs, and backend services. It supports routing, request handling, template rendering, and extensions for features like databases, authentication, and form handling. Because of its simplicity and flexibility, Flask is popular among beginners and professionals for rapid development.",
